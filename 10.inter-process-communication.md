**Inter-Process Communication** (IPC) is a mechanism that allows processes to communicate and synchronize their actions while executing concurrently within an operating system. IPC is essential for enabling cooperation between processes, especially in multi-tasking environments.

### Key Features: -

1. **Data Exchange**: IPC facilitates the exchange of data and information between processes, which can be running on the same machine or across different machines in a network.
2. **Process Coordination**: It helps in coordinating activities among processes, ensuring that they work together efficiently without conflicts.
3. **Resource Management**: IPC allows processes to manage shared resources, such as memory and files, which is crucial for optimizing performance and preventing resource contention.
4. **Modularity**: By enabling processes to communicate, IPC promotes modular design in software development, allowing different components to be developed and maintained independently.

### Common IPC Mechanisms: -

IPC can be implemented through various mechanisms, each suited for different scenarios.

1. **Shared Memory**:
   Processes can access a common memory space to read and write data. This method is fast but requires synchronization to prevent race conditions.
2. **Message Passing**:
   Processes send and receive messages to communicate.
   - **Direct Communication**: Processes explicitly name each other to send and receive messages.
   - **Indirect Communication**: Messages are sent to and received from mailboxes or ports, which can facilitate communication between multiple processes.
3. **Pipes**:
   A unidirectional communication channel that allows data to flow from one process to another. Named pipes can provide bidirectional communication.
4. **Sockets**:
   Used for communication between processes over a network. Sockets allow data exchange between processes on different machines.
5. **Signals**:
   Used to notify processes of events, such as the completion of a task or the occurrence of an error. Signals are lightweight and often used for simple notifications.
