The **Process Control Block** (PCB) is a data structure the operating system uses to manage and control processes. It contains all the information needed to handle a process, including its state, priority, and resource usage. The following are key components:

**Process State**: It defines the current state of the process (i.e. new, ready, running, waiting, terminated). It helps the OS determine what actions can be performed on the process.

**Process ID (PID)**: A unique identifier is assigned to each process to distinguish between processes.

**Program Counter**: This counter stores the address of the next instruction to be executed, allowing the OS to resume execution from where the process left off.

**CPU Registers**: This part stores the values of CPU registers when the process is not running, helping the OS to restore the process's state when it resumes execution.

**CPU Scheduling Information**: Includes the process priority, pointers to scheduling queues, etc. This information determines when and how the process will be scheduled for execution.

**Memory Management Information**: Contains data about the process's memory usage, such as page tables and base/limit registers, helping the OS to manage the process's memory allocation.

**Accounting Information**: It holds the statistics about the process, such as CPU time used, real-time usage, etc. to help the OS to track resource usage for accounting and auditing purposes.

The **Process lifecycle** in an operating system is a critical concept that describes the various states a process goes through from creation to termination.

### 1. **Start**

This is the initial state of a process when it is created.

- **Process Creation**: The operating system creates a new process using a system call such as `fork()` , which duplicates the parent process. This new process is then assigned a unique process identifier (PID).
- **Key Activities**:
  - **Initialization**: The OS allocates memory for the process and initializes its control block, which contains information about the process state, priority, and resource usage.
  - **Loading**: The executable code is loaded into memory, and the process is prepared for execution.

### 2. Ready

In this state, the process is ready to run but is waiting for CPU allocation.

- **Process Scheduler**: The operating system uses a scheduler to manage which processes get CPU time. The ready state can contain multiple processes waiting for execution.
- **Key Activities**:
  - **Context Switching**: The OS may switch between processes in the ready state based on scheduling algorithms (e.g., First-Come-First-Served, Round Robin).
  - **Resource Allocation**: The process is prepared to use system resources, such as memory and I/O devices, as soon as it gets CPU time.

### 3. Running

The process is actively executing instructions on the CPU.

- **Execution**: The CPU fetches and executes the process's instructions. The process can modify its state, access memory, and perform I/O operations.
- **Key Activities**:
  - **Instruction Execution**: The CPU executes the process's instructions, which may include arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and system calls.
  - **State Change**: During execution, the process may need to wait for resources (e.g., I/O operations), which transitions it to the waiting state.

### 4. Waiting

Processes often wait for resources that are currently unavailable, such as user input or data from a disk.

**Key Activities**:

- **Event Monitoring**: The OS monitors the waiting processes and will transition them back to the ready state once the required resources become available.
- **Resource Management**: The OS manages resource allocation to ensure that processes can access the necessary resources without deadlock.

### 5. Finished (or Exit)

The process reaches this state when it has completed its execution or has been terminated.

- **Termination**: The process may finish successfully or be terminated due to errors, user intervention, or system constraints.
- **Key Activities**:
  - **Resource Deallocation**: The OS reclaims all resources allocated to the process, including memory and file handles.
  - **Exit Status**: The process returns an exit status to the parent process, indicating whether it was completed successfully or encountered errors.
  - **Removal from Process Table**: The process is removed from the OS's process table, which tracks all active processes.
