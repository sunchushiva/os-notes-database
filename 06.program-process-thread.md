## Program

A program is a **passive** entity, an executable file with instructions to perform a specific task / to complete a job or operation on your computer.

Some key features of a program in the context of operating systems: -

- **Nature**: Programs are static and inactive until executed.
- **Storage**: Programs exist as files in secondary memory.
- **Execution**: Programs are not directly executable by the computer. They need an interpreter or compiler to be executed.
- **Resources**: Programs do not consume system resources while not running.
- **Examples**: Microsoft Word, Photoshop, Web Browsers.

## Process

A process is an **active** instance of a program currently being executed by the Operating System. It includes the program's code, data, and system resources needed for its execution.

Some key characteristics of a process: -

- **Nature**: Processes are dynamic and active entities.
- **Lifecycle**: The lifecycle of a process is dynamic and can change between different states like new, ready, running, waiting, terminated, etc.
- **Resources**: Processes consume system resources like CPU, memory, and I/O devices during execution.
- **Interaction**: Processes interact with the operating system and other processes through system calls.
- **Creation**: Processes are created by the operating system when a program is executed.

## Thread

A thread is a lightweight **unit of execution** within a process. It is a single sequential flow of control that can execute independently within a process.

Some key characteristics of threads:

- **Lightweight**: Threads are lightweight compared to processes as they share resources like memory and files.
- **Components**: Each thread has its program counter, register set and stack space.
- **Execution**: Threads execute sequentially but give the illusion of parallel execution.
- **Sharing**: Threads share the same memory and resources within a process.
- **Scheduling**: Threads are scheduled by the operating system to execute on the CPU.
