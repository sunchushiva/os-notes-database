A program is a **passive** entity stored on a secondary memory like a hard disk. When a program is executed, it is converted into an **active** instance that can be run by the CPU of a computer system.

To understand how a program gets converted into a process in an operating system, we need to delve into several key stages involved in this transformation. Each stage ensures that the program executes accurately and efficiently.

### 1. Program Creation

Source code is essential because it serves as the foundational blueprint for any software application, which is a set of **human-readable** instructions written in a programming language (e.g., Python, C++, Java). This code defines the logic and functionality of the software.

### 2. Compilation

The source code is processed by a compiler, which translates the high-level instructions into low-level machine code or object code. This step is crucial because computers can only execute **machine code **but this code generated is not executable.

### 3. Linking

After compilation, the linker combines one or more object files into a single **executable** file. This process resolves references between different object files, ensuring that function calls and variable references are correctly linked.

**Types of Linking**:

- **Static Linking**: All necessary libraries are combined into the executable at compile time.
- **Dynamic Linking**: Libraries are linked at runtime, allowing for smaller executable sizes and easier updates.

### 4. Loading

The loader is responsible for loading the executable file into memory. It allocates memory for the process and sets up the execution environment.

**Memory Layout**:

- **Text Segment**: The text segment, also known as the code segment, contains the compiled machine code of the program. This is the section where the executable instructions reside.
- **Initialized Data Segment**: This segment, often referred to simply as the data segment, contains all global and static variables that are initialized by the programmer at the time of declaration.
- **Uninitialized Data Segment: **The uninitialized data segment contains all global and static variables that are declared but not initialized.
- **Heap**: The heap is a memory segment used for dynamic memory allocation. It allows programs to request and release memory at runtime.
- **Stack**: The stack segment is used for static memory allocation, which includes local variables and function call management.

### 5. Process Creation

- When a user executes the program, the operating system creates a new process by duplicating the shell process using the `fork()` system call. This results in a child process.
- The child process then calls one of the `exec()` functions to replace its memory space with the programâ€™s executable code. This effectively transforms the child process into the program that is to be executed.

### 6. Process Execution

- The operating system schedules the new process for execution. The CPU fetches and executes the program instructions sequentially.
- The OS manages multiple processes by **context-switching** between them, ensuring that each process gets CPU time.

### 7. Process Termination

- When the program finishes executing, the process terminates. The operating system reclaims any resources allocated to the process, including memory and file descriptors.
- The process may return an **exit status** to the parent process (the shell), indicating whether it was completed successfully or encountered an error.
