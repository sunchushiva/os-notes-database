There are two parts to the Computer System: **Software** and **Hardware**.

## Software

**Software** refers to the collection of programs, data, and instructions that tell a computer or other electronic devices how to perform specific tasks.

Software can be categorized into several types:

1. **System Software**: This includes operating systems (like Windows, macOS, or Linux) that manage hardware and provide a platform for running application software. System software also includes utility programs that perform maintenance tasks.
2. **Application Software**: These are programs designed to perform specific tasks for users, such as word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word), spreadsheets (e.g., Excel), and web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. **Development Software**: Tools and environments used for creating other software, such as compilers, IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), and debuggers.
4. **Middleware**: Software that provides common services and capabilities to applications outside of what's offered by the operating system, often used in distributed systems.
5. **Firmware**: Specialized software that is embedded in hardware devices, providing low-level control and interfacing between the hardware and higher-level software.

## Hardware

**Hardware** refers to the physical components of a computer system or electronic device, it encompasses all the tangible parts that you can see and touch. These components work together to perform computing tasks and support software applications.

Categories of Hardware: -

1. Processing
2. Storage
   - Main memory
   - Secondary memory
3. Input/Output
   - Keyboard
   - Mouse
   - Display
4. Peripherals
   - Printers
   - Scanners
